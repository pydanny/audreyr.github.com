{{ page.title }}
================

[PyDanny](http://pydanny.com) and I went to [LA Tech Happy Hour](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Tech-Happy-Hour/) tonight.  Yay for two good Valley meetups on consecutive nights!

Here's [C.J. Windisch](http://twitter.com/slashcj) showing off his company [Slash8](http://slash-8.com)'s new app, which he and [Zach Sekar](http://twitter.com/slashzach) launched last night.  First, he scans the QR code on phone #2 with phone #1:

Then he enters in a payment amount on phone #1 and sends it:

As you can see, Slash8 is an app for paying others with your mobile phone.  To authorize payment from your account to someone else's, you scan their QR code with your phone camera, then you specify how much you want to pay them.

Demos Are Fun
-------------

Danny and I shamelessly pulled out a laptop to show off the progress we've made with our startup, [Consumer Notebook](http://consumernotebook.com).  We also cornered several entrepreneurs into giving us impromptu demos.  It was all in good fun.

The Power of Artichokes
-----------------------

When you go to a tech meetup at a restaurant/bar, order a grilled artichoke if they serve them.  Why?

* You'll spend less time talking and more time listening.  You'll ask a question, then listen while you eat some delicious artichoke leaves.  You'll listen longer, because those leaves really are tasty.  You'll learn very interesting things.
* Artichokes are good for you.

[The Federal Bar](http://thefederalbar.com) has some extremely delicious garlic parmesan lemon artichokes.  I cannot recommend them enough.
