Here's my latest illustration, titled "The Anti-Physics of Thin Air":

In case you haven't traveled high enough to see the top of a rainbow, this is what happens: 

* The air becomes very, very thin.
* Rainbow curvature distorts sharply. That's why rainbows appear to be circular arcs from the ground. What you see from the ground is an optical illusion, similar to the illusions in the architecture of the [Parthenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon).
* Trees grow on top of rainbows. Kites get stuck in these rainbow-trees.
* Clouds who wish to rise to that altitude must be supported by balloons.

Strange, isn't it?  I'm pretty certain that my facts are correct (after all, I did study engineering at MIT).

This piece is designed to be a 16-foot by 8-foot mural.  I am currently looking for a blank wall in the Los Angeles area that could use a rainbow.
