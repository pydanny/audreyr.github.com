title: San Fernando Valley Developers Meetup

{{ page.title }}
================

Tonight was the [SFV Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sfv-developers/events/51662142/).  Pretty good turnout - I have a feeling we're going to overtake Silicon Valley as the premier tech hub soon.

Python Requests
---------------

The highlight of the meetup was when [Danny](http://pydanny.com) explained to Daniel (a different one) that he should use the [Python Requests](http://python-requests.org) library.  

Proof is here.  This is Danny's writing:

![Danny says you should use Python Requests](/img/blog/pydanny-says-use-requests.jpg "Use Python Requests!")

More evidence from [@bryanveloso](http://twitter.com/bryanveloso/):

It's a good library.  It really ought to be part of the Python standard library, I think.

When is the next one?
---------------------

The next one is going to be on March 1, 2012.

If you know of any devs who live/work in the San Fernando Valley or don't mind the drive, let them know.  Or if you know of a Valley company who can host the meetup, let us know.  Details will be posted on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/sfv-developers/events/51662142/).
