title: An Exploration of Harvey Balls Ideograms
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Harvey Balls are often used in comparison tables, as a way to compare data quickly at a glance.  There are several variations on them.  Typically, they look something like this:

See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Balls">the Wikipedia entry</a> for more info.

For <a href="http://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a>'s comparison grid feature, I'm exploring new alternative representations of the traditional ideograms.  Here are a few variations that I'm playing around with:

Letter Grades
-------------

These versions feature the standard "report card" letter grades in the center:

The nice thing about this version is that letter grades are very intuitive without explanation.

Pie Slices
----------

This version applies my color palette to the traditional pie slice ideograms:

Donuts
------

This version consists of donuts of varying sizes:

Emoticons
---------

Imagine you have a comparison grid of products where feelings are relevant.  For example, suppose you're comparing bicycle helmets and have a feature called Comfort, which you want to evaluate with ideograms to represent satisfaction:

Explanation
-----------

These ideograms are shown in oversized form here.  When placed into columns of a comparison grid, they'd be much smaller.  Picture them as the bubbles on a Scantron sheet, easily scannable by the eye for rapid visual analysis.

The color scheme I'm using is one I've built upon for several years now.  Think of the balls as fruits ranging from unripe to overripe.  In RGB, it's roughly a simple transform to step from one unit to the next.  

Using simple color blocks would be inadequate, since 8% of males and 0.5% of females are color blind.  Accessibility is very important.  The following would be hard for color blind individuals to read:
