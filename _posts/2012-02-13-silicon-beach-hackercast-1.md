================

Python open-source developer [Daniel Greenfeld](http://pydanny.com) and Clojure/Ruby open-source developer [Andrew Cholakian](http://andrewvc.com) have recorded the first episode of the Silicon Beach Hackercast.

Here they are at the recording studio:

They discussed:

* Python at Scale 10X
* New clients asking you to complete the ‘last 10%’
* A rant about job titles
* Why is clojure blowing up?

At one point they ranted about the terms &ldquo;rockstar&rdquo; and &ldquo;ninja&rdquo;.  (In case you don't know, those are words that were once compliments for software developers but have since turned into rather derogatory terms.)  

I drew this flyer to help promote episode 1:
