          <h2>Digital Rainbows: 2007-2010</h2>
          <p>In 2007, I became obsessed with rainbows and clouds.</p>
          <p>I was getting ready for Mission Open Studios 2007, painting landscapes for the show.  At some point, I realized that I could write a computer program to automate the process, so I did.</p>
          <h3>Rainbows: Series 1</h3>
          <p>Series 1 consists of my early rainbows.</p>
          <h3>Rainbows: Series 1.5</h3>
          <p>Series 1.5 consists of developments in the structure of my rainbows.  Some of these pieces do not even contain rainbows.</p>
          <h3>Rainbows: Series 2</h3>
          <p>Series 2 shows an evolution of my generative art techniques and refinement of my printing process.</p>
          <h3>Propaganda</h3>
          <p>A video and accompanying booklet full of subversive rainbow propaganda.</p>
