================

Design Jams is a project that brings together designers from various disciplines to work on social and community issues.

There are a lot of problems that are too hard for one person to solve, but that could easily be solved by bringing people together to brainstorm, rapid-prototype, and test.

One of the people behind the project is [Crystal Ehrlich](http://www.crystal-ehrlich.com/), the organizer of the LA User Experience meetup, which has over 1700 members.

I think it's an amazing idea.  

They're trying to get a $500 grant to help them secure meeting spaces, pay for supplies, etc.  The project is up for voting on GOOD Maker through April 17 at 12pm PDT - please vote and help them get it going:
