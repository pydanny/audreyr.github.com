================

I hope this works.

Background
----------

I read <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Tom Preston-Werner's blog post</a> about how he developed Jekyll in order to store his writing in a Git repo, just like code.

I love the idea of this.

I should break this blog post into two at some point, or at least delete the following sections.  But right now I'm just playing around with it.

Plants That Repel Ants
----------------------

I was researching plants with ant-repellent properties.  Here are some of the most promising ones that I found:

* Mints, especially spearmint
* Tansy
* Lavender
* Sage
* Pennyroyal

Notice that they are all herbs.  Apparently, ants don't like strongly-scented plants.

Do They Really Work?
--------------------

After reading various gardening forums for hours, I've found enough anecdotes about ants being attracted to mint, lavender, sage, etc. that I don't think they really work that well.

But it might be worth a try.
