================

I'm excited to announce that my startup, Consumer Notebook, has been chosen for PyCon 2012's Startup Row!

What is PyCon?
--------------

PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the Python programming language community.  It is a conference with over 120 sponsors, including Dropbox, Heroku, and Google.  

PyCon is also the conference where Danny and I met in 2010 :)

Consumer Notebook got mentioned on [the official PyCon blog announcement about Startup Row](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html).  Check it out.

What is PyCon Startup Row?
--------------------------

Startup Row is where the most promising Python-using startups are highlighted at PyCon.  These startups are given a demo area, and the founders are given free admission to PyCon.  

The startups chosen to be featured this year are:

* [GetCloak](https://www.getcloak.com/)
* [Quantopian](http://www.quantopian.com/)
* [SwiftStack](http://www.swiftstack.com/)
* [StrongSteam](http://strongsteam.com/)
* [BugSense](http://www.bugsense.com/)
* [WeddingLovely](http://www.weddinglovely.com/)
* [Transifex](http://www.transifex.net/)
* [Consumer Notebook](http://consumernotebook.com/) (whoa, that's us!)
* [pythonpackages.com](http://pythonpackages.com/)
* [Qwikon](http://www.qwikon.com/)
* [Trendulate](http://trendulate.com/)
* [Lambda Foundry](http://www.lambdafoundry.com/)

Startup Row attracted massive attention last year.  This year it is anticipated to be even better, since PyCon is being held in Silicon Valley and is fully sold out.

Stop by the Consumer Notebook booth on Saturday, March 10
---------------------------------------------------------

If you're going to be at PyCon, make sure you say hi to me and Danny at the booth.  Don't forget!

We're thrilled.  Having a booth there is exactly the boost we needed to give us a deadline to work toward, and to help us get word out to fellow developers about Consumer Notebook and its API.

Thank you, PyCon!
