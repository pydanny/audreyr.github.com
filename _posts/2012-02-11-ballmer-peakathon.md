================

The [Ballmer Peakathon](http://www.ballmerpeakathon.com/) is a wacky event centered around empirically testing the premise of XKCD's Ballmer Peak:

At the Ballmer Peakathon, attendees spent an evening coming up with and building ridiculous web applications while being treated to an open bar.  

The web apps had to match equally ridiculous domain names, ones picked out by the nutty [Originate](http://www.originate.com/) management team.

Here are some of the highlights from the demos:

Bloated Startup
---------------

Bloated Startup is a web app for looking up how bloated a startup is.  

You enter in the name of a startup, and it generates a whitepaper about how bloated the startup is, including startup nutrition facts.

FrogJab
-------

FrogJab is a web-based multiplayer game where you manipulate frogs with laser-tongues and try to catch flies.  Built on node.js, the game allows 2 players to play against each other on separate computers.

GlamKittenz
-----------

GlamKittenz is a browser-based app for dressing up a kitten in various costumes.  Drag kitten dresses, hats, and accessories onto the kitten for maximum enjoyment.

What did I work on?
-------------------

I worked with Daniel Greenfeld, Keenahn Jung, Sophia Viklund, and Tim on a web app called WTF Is This For?  It was a site where startups enter their pitches, and the community offers feedback of various sorts.  If we have time, we'll try and deploy it somewhere.
