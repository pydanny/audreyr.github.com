title: Plants That Repel Ants
---

{{ page.title }}
================

I was researching plants with ant-repellent properties.  Here are some of the most promising ones that I found:

* Mints, especially spearmint
* Tansy
* Lavender
* Sage
* Pennyroyal

Notice that they are all herbs.  Apparently, ants don't like strongly-scented plants.

Do They Really Work?
--------------------

After reading various gardening forums for hours, I've found enough anecdotes about ants being attracted to mint, lavender, sage, etc. that I don't think they really work that well.

But it might be worth a try.
